                              Software</em> are programs that can recognise and record audible commands of the human

                        programs.

                  <p>
                        The first inkling of voice technology came about through the efforts of <em>Thomas Edison</em>.
                        He created the device from a combination of his previous inventions: telephone and telegraph.
                        The thought that he could record telephone messages, similar to how telegraphic messages and
                        words are recorded through indentations on paper is what sparked him to create the first device
                        that could record sound and play it back. This decide was created on 4th December, 1877.

                  <p>
                        Next came the <strong>Voder</strong>, the first speech synthesiser, a machine created to mimic
                        how humans talk, which was invented by <em>A team</em> of engineers at <em>Bell Labs</em>, led
                        by <em>Homer Dudley</em> in 1936 as an attempt to further communication technology. The first
                        real voice recognition software was also made by <em>Bell Labs</em>, who created
                        <strong>Audrey</strong>, a program capable of recognising the digits from 0 to 9 with 90%
                        accuracy.

                        <strong>Voice technology</strong> has come a long way developing to the adaptations of ever
                        changing lifestyles of people. It was introduced by <em>Thomas Edison</em> into the world and
                        made its first evolution in 1950, when <em>Bell Labs</em> invented <strong>Voder</strong>, then
                        <strong>Audrey</strong>, an automatic digit recognition machine. This was then enhanced overtime
                        with more vocabularies recognised either by speech patterns, fixed templates, or sounds and
                        pitch. It reached a major breakthrough in 2010 where <em>Google</em> invented an application
                        called <strong>Google Voice Search</strong>. With this advancement, it paved the way for
                        <em>Siri</em> whose success only pushed the voice technology to shoot up. Because of this,
                        companies now created their own digital assistants we now widely use in our everyday life such
                        as <em>Siri, Amazon Alexa, Cortana, Google, Bixby</em>, etc. Integrations of voice assistants
                        into our daily gadgets i.e. mobile phones, pushed more devices that are used in different
                        settings i.e. home, hospitals, schools, cars, businesses, and more. Since more consumers are
                        leaning towards the digital world, indsutries are now widely adopting this era, where voice
                        technology benefits businesses' capability to generate revenue, improve efficiency and increase
                        productivity. According to the <em>Industry Report: Trends and Predictions for Voice Technology
                        in 2021</em> by Speechmatics, 68% of respondents currently have voice strategy in place in
                        their company compared with 50% in 2020. Those who doesn't have voice strategy, 60% said that it
                        is something they will consider in the next 5 years. With the pandemic <em>COVID-19</em> hitting
                        globally, companies are more inclines to shift into voice technology, where many industries like
                        media and entertaiinment, banking, financial services, insurance, healthcare and life sciences,
                        education, government, etc have proven that voice technology's capabilities are limitless, and
                        there is no stopping it.

                        Voice Technology, as part of the biometric technology tree, also possesses its owen sibling
                        technology branches that focuses on recognising and identifying other human biological features.
                        The biosignature that can be anything from <em>facial features, fingerprints, iris, etc.</em>
                        These biometric features are used for security reasons and identifying other people. Compared to
                        voice technology, these other biometric signatures are not able to convey orders and information
                        as effectively as human speech can.
