                    <strong>Voice Technology</strong>, also known as <em>Voice Search</em> or <em>Voice Recognition Software</em> are programs 
                    that can recognise and record audible commands of the human language and translate them into code i.e. computer language, 
                    that can interact with other programs.

                <h1> Development </h1>
                <p>
                    The first inkling of voice technology came about through the efforts of <em>Thomas Edison</em>. He created the 
                    device from a combination of his previous inventions: telephone and telegraph. The thought that he could record 
                    telephone messages, similar to how telegraphic messages and words are recorded through indentations on paper is 
                    what sparked him to create the first device that could record sound and play it back. This decide was created on
                    4th December, 1877.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Next came the <strong>Voder</strong>, the first speech synthesiser, a machine created to mimic how humans talk, 
                    which was invented by <em>A team</em> of engineers at <em>Bell Labs</em>, led by <em>Homer Dudley</em> in 1936 
                    as an attempt to further communication technology. The first real voice recognition software was also made by 
                    <em>Bell Labs</em>, who created <strong>Audrey</strong>, a program capable of recognising the digits from 0 to 9
                    with 90% accuracy.

            <div class="content_3">
                <h1>Management</h1>
	            <p>
		            It's a competitive and open market. There is no central body which governs voice recognition technology. However, 
                    there are prominent developers and companies that contribute tremendously in the field:

                <p>
                    <strong>Voice technology</strong> has come a long way developing to the adaptations of ever changing lifestyles of people. 
                    It was introduced by <em>Thomas Edison</em> into the world and made its first evolution in 1950, when <em>Bell Labs</em> 
                    invented <strong>Voder</strong>, then <strong>Audrey</strong>, an automatic digit recognition machine. This was then enhanced 
                    overtime with more vocabularies recognised either by speech patterns, fixed templates, or sounds and pitch. It reached a major 
                    breakthrough in 2010 where <em>Google</em> invented an application called <strong>Google Voice Search</strong>. With this advancement, 
                    it paved the way for <em>Siri</em> whose success only pushed the voice technology to shoot up. Because of this, companies now created 
                    their own digital assistants we now widely use in our everyday life such as <em>Siri, Amazon Alexa, Cortana, Google, Bixby</em>, etc. 
                    Integrations of voice assistants into our daily gadgets i.e. mobile phones, pushed more devices that are used in different settings 
                    i.e. home, hospitals, schools, cars, businesses, and more. Since more consumers are leaning towards the digital world, indsutries are 
                    now widely adopting this era, where voice technology benefits businesses' capability to generate revenue, improve efficiency and increase 
                    productivity. According to the <em>Industry Report: Trends and Predictions for Voice Technology in 2021</em> by Speechmatics, 
                    68% of respondents currently have voice strategy in place in their company compared with 50% in 2020. Those who doesn't have voice 
                    strategy, 60% said that it is something they will consider in the next 5 years. With the pandemic <em>COVID-19</em> hitting globally, 
                    companies are more inclines to shift into voice technology, where many industries like media and entertaiinment, banking, financial services, 
                    insurance, healthcare and life sciences, education, government, etc have proven that voice technology's capabilities are limitless, and there 
                    is no stopping it.

                <p>
                    Voice Technology, as part of the biometric technology tree, also possesses its owen sibling technology branches that focuses on recognising 
                    and identifying other human biological features. The biosignature that can be anything from <em>facial features, fingerprints, iris, etc.</em> 
                    These biometric features are used for security reasons and identifying other people. Compared to voice technology, these other biometric 
                    signatures are not able to convey orders and information as effectively as human speech can.
